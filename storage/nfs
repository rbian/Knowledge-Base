Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984,[1] allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a network much like local storage is accessed. NFS, like many other protocols, builds on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC) system. The Network File System is an open standard defined in RFCs, allowing anyone to implement the protocol.

There are three ways to configure an NFS server under Red Hat Enterprise Linux: using the NFS Server Configuration Tool (redhat-config-nfs), manually editing its configuration file (/etc/exports), or using the /usr/sbin/exportfs command.

For instructions on using NFS Server Configuration Tool, refer to the chapter titled Network File System (NFS) in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux System Administration Guide. The remainder of this section discusses manually editing /etc/exports and using the /usr/sbin/exportfs command to export NFS file systems.
