cgroups (abbreviated from control groups) is a Linux kernel feature that limits, accounts for and isolates the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc.) of a collection of processes.

Engineers at Google (primarily Paul Menage and Rohit Seth) started the work on this feature in 2006, under the name "process containers".[1] In late 2007 the nomenclature changed to "control groups" due to the confusion caused by multiple meanings of the term "container" in the Linux kernel context, and control-group functionality merged into kernel version 2.6.24.[2] Since then, developers have added many new features and controllers, such as support for kernfs,[3] firewalling,[4] and unified hierarchy
